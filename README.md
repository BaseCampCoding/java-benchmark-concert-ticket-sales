# Java Benchmark - Concert Ticket Sales

For this benchmark you are building software to automate selling concert tickets. Right now, this is a manual process with a lot of hand calculations and tedious paperwork. The flow generally works like this:

The concert venue owner maintains a list of the upcoming shows. This list includes the information relevant to potential ticket buyers about each show: name of the artist headlining the show, the price of a ticket, the date and time of the show, and the number of tickets available.

A customer would come to the shop, look at the list of available shows, and tell the venue owner that they want to buy a ticket for a particular show. The venue owner asks for the customer's name, and then prints out a ticket that includes the show's information and the customer's name. After selling a ticket, the venue owner does two things: updates the show listings to reflect that a ticket was sold, and adds an entry into a spreadsheet that says he sold a ticket that particular show at the current time.

Your job is to write two Java applications to automate this work. You should write a customer facing application that lets them see the list of upcoming shows and purchase a ticket. You should also write an application for the venue owner that lets them add a new show to the list of upcoming shows and see the history of ticket purchases.

## Requirements

A customer must be able to:

- View the available shows
- Purchase a ticket to a show

An admin must be able to:

- Add a show
- See a history of ticket purchases

Your code should be readable.

Your applications should be usable.

## Levels of Success

- You complete one of the applications with hard coded data.
- You complete one of the applications with data stored in a file.
- You complete both of the applications with data stored in a file.

## Submission

Email Sean, Nate, and Fernae a link to the Github repository containing your solution.
